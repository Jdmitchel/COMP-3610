## üìë Assignment #1 Submissions

- Submit your assignments here: **[Submission Portal](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbybfWedphGulToqUvqBIq_VtK4HNJnqcbq5cDUtusEaMEvtgSddWXIAJzmsevJCQZOS9w/exec)**
- Due Date: Friday, Febrary 23rd 2024, 11:59 PM.
- Late submissions accepted up to Tuesday, February 27th 2024, 11:59 PM. 5% penalty applied for each day late, up to a maximum of 20%.

###Trusting the Unverified App

When you first use the submission portal, becuase Google hasn't verified the app, you'll encounter a warning screen. This guide will show you how to proceed safely.
- Step 1: Encounter the Warning Screen

Upon attempting to authorize the submission portal, you'll see a screen like this:

Google displays this warning because the app is not verified. This is a standard procedure for all new or unverified apps accessing Google services.
Step 2: Proceed to <App Name> (Unsafe)

To continue, click on Advanced to reveal more options.

After clicking Advanced, you'll see an option to go to <App Name> (unsafe). Click on it to proceed.

Step 3: Grant Permissions

Next, you'll see a screen asking for permissions <App Name> needs to operate. Review the permissions, and if you agree, click Allow.

Step 4: You're All Set!

After granting permissions, you should be redirected back to the app, now fully authorized to use <App Name>.
Why Does This Happen?

Google requires all apps to go through a verification process to access Google services. This process involves a security review to ensure the app complies with Google's policies. Until an app is verified, Google shows these warnings to protect users from potentially harmful apps.

<App Name> is in the process of getting verified. These warnings will disappear once Google verifies the app.
