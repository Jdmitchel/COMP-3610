      "returned eleventh trip dlp hubby son daughter almost missing already negative points time overall loved fab time cannot recommend dlp especially disney fans children truly magical experience little ones night stay sequoia lodge hotel chose hotel time stayed previously know 'cosy' 'comfy' hotel plus knew recently refurbished wanted check montana room decor bambi style lovely classic disney touch rooms little smallish side stayed new york last couple times forgot rooms little larger comfortable seasoned pro's remembered teabags coffee travel kettle etc tea making facilities room like us like little home comforts like must remember bring disapointed lack milk everywhere apart milk breakfast time can't get dlp anywhere nice stuff anyway buy couple cartons hotel shop gross really creamy like condensed yuk anyone knows buy 'proper' milk dlp please let know also swimming pool sequoia lodge freezing info reception desk said water degrees way son could manage stay minutes hubby daughter managed little longer way cold enjoyable went sat jacuzzi warmed nicely way get back seating area changing rooms go normal 'freezing' pool awful took breath away ridiculous idea breakfast good although missed bacon potato slices like offer better hotels children enjoyed ham yoghurts disney characters appearing foyer donald goofy mickey minnie that's remember three star hotel pay hotel wise better class character get speak celebration spring disneyland park town square main street castle stage decorated brightly coloured flowers looked really pretty flower characters gardens front castle lovely satisfied cleanliness etc grounds usual first evening little girl insisted walking around barefoot dressed rapunzel 'rapunzel wear shoes ' many people quite happy knew paths etc clean however one cast member point daughter wearing shoes husband got bit defensive little princess sarcastically asked shoe policy park lady replied yes ooops never knew oh well learn something new every trip managed get loads rides queueing bad considering weekend british bank holiday one point hardly anyone casey jnr goes almost continuously running round barriers queue great fun really quick tunarounds small world snow white carousel railroad tea cups la pays des contes de fees buzz lightyear pirates longest queues experienced orbitron peter pan course big thunder mountain talking big thunder mountain son started getting really upset wanting go right point get seats nightmare however lovely cast member kindly offered stand son side get could still go ride kind gesture went autopia first time great always thought go round circle ride always avoided great fun go lovely little journey car steer loved went twice year old much better job steering much amusement can't believe missed little gem last years husband love disney railroad train goes around park dropping picking stations along way chance sit back rest feet still enjoying sights sounds park get tend stay hour going round one year even ate lunch save bit time lovely good chance charge batteries please remember check planned ride closures book could cause disapointment arrive dumbo closed least knew beforehand get fed rides plently things explore alice's curious labyrinth never gets boring sleeping beauty's castle must us every trip frontierland fort adventure isle les mysteres nautilus one thing disapointed lack characters appearing park looking back years ago loads standing around meet n greets gave place real magical feel spotting characters round every corner special areas queue ages see one person ie mickey mouse rapunzel princesses pavillion etc wish would bring characters children love see cannot really grumble princess pavillion though lucky score last year daughter went twice saw snow white belle year went three times manged see cinderella sleeping beauty ariel favourites lucky seen without doubling think partly kind cast members point us diverted designated room two ways go rooms containing princess cast members allowed tell ones asked daughter already seen subtle wink wink swift change direction implmented kind makes hour long queue morning get time slots worthwhile never thought would say though encounter rude cast members time really unusual experienced different encounters included ignoring us chatting colleagues stood front unhelpfulness asking something rude abrubt attitudes speaking us make stay magical ethos every cast member add though small minority amongst hundreds cast members lovely proud magic parade ok definately missing floats characters last year i'm sure princess tiana prince naveen aladdin jasmine ariel belle peter pan missing parade little disapointing made fact frozen made appearance much overwhelming delight frozen obsessed daughter indeed much crowd think queen elsa made daughters day pointing waving daughter wearing elsa dress one ecstatic child disney dreams night time show fireworks really great shame late pm surely pm would ok five year old struggling stay awake watch missed though meals would definately recommend meal vouchers chose half board plus quite varied selection restaurants choose first time used found made life much easier one thing look forward dlp holiday food situation found really stressful trying find somewhere eat day costly making reservations also helped big weight minds knowing booked tables place evening paid advance favourite meal walt's table window overlooking main street warm relaxing rather sumptuous environment beautifully furnished walt memorabilia food delicious waiting staff lovely definately recommended also ate well steakhouse hunter's grill sequoia lodge plaza gardens plaza garden's firm favourite eat buffet really tasty food little choice children unlike set meal table service restaurant say normally burger fries counter service restauants slightly different story best describe slow slow slow get wrong food nice staff restaurants slow tills behind counters felt wasted much time queues careful often make mistakes order really needed use restaurants lunch knowing big evening meal booked felt really need much actually found could buy one adult meal husband share one childs meal two children shared enough us especially also vouchers pause gourmade teatime treat valid pm saved lot money good counter service restauant would recommend toad hall seems faster service plus helpful staff good food also beware unexpected restaurant closures one day stay lunchtime found five yes five major counter service restaurants unexpectedly closed given explanation reason open morning odd help particularly rainy wet day people wanted sit inside course knock effect remaining restaurants open got extremely busy thank goodness cowboy cookout frontierland big resuarant loads seating always good back plan can't get anywhere else well think that's waffled long enough hope found review helpful know negatives points overall really love dlp intend go back many times feeling moment could little better feel seems lost way little issues lot problems could easily remedied think anyway want say look pull socks bit let's get back good times years ago place really

new york hotel misc got stopped multiple times using selfie stick mobile phone taking pictures one staff explained rides people take selfie sticks risk injury damage perfectly agree however staff also stopped multiple times taking pictures using selfie stick even open areas people rides shows overall able take multiple pictures pausing opening bag taking couple photos stick putting back bag bit unpleasant happened open areas since felt staff use discretion people allowed use sticks hand dlp also permit smoking parks besides designated smoking areas however massive smoking main street open areas inside parks disney staff could care less walking shops restaurants rides times could stand cigarette smoke days daughter exposed passive smoke compared last year outside dlp disney completely ban smoking kind inside parks allow carrying cigarettes inside parks smoking areas outside parks conclusion dlp like dream truly magical place children however hotels priced lack healthy food availability stunning disney improve aspect parks would get star rating time final conclusion despite overpriced hotels food issues points children trip missed know heading better prepared ensure trip
